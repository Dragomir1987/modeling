Description				& Implementation of the train data with the corresponding interfaces to track, driver and RBC.\newline
Data first is received from the train (TIU).\\
& 
Second step: train data is sent to the driver (DMI).
The part relevant for driver interface is confirmed by the driver and sent back to the evc.\\
& 
Data received via this interface is merged with the data received via TIU.\newline
Message Flow:\\
& 
sending Message 129 (Validated Train Data)\\
& 
receiving Message 8 (Acknowledment of Train Data) is processed as apart of the validation procedure with the RBC.\\
& 
sending Message 146 (Acknolwedement) in the context of this message flow. T\_TRAIN parameter of the messages is used to confirm the association of the messages.\\
&
trainData uses a dedicated state for controlling the receiption of the acknowledgement.\\

\subsection{Interface}

An overview of the interface of component trainData is shown in Figure~\ref{f:traindata_interface}. The inputs and outputs are described in detail in Section~\ref{s:traindata_inputs} respectively \ref{s:traindata_outputs}. Sub components are described in Section~\ref{s:traindata_subcomponents}.
